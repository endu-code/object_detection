This Package is meant to serve as a template for object detection for a robotics application. In this package a multithreaded R\+OS node is launched to capture frames from a 2D camera and process those images in order to detect shapes and match them against a set of samples. From those samples the x and y coordinates in the camera frame will be send via R\+O\+S-\/\+Message for other R\+OS nodes to subscribe to.

The Goal is that those coordinates can be used for picking up workpieces in an industrial application.
